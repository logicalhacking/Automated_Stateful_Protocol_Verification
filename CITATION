                   i.e., protocols with mutable state that may span several sessions.

                   authentication. We also include a simple user-friendly

        abstract  = {In protocol verification we observe a wide spectrum from
                     fully automated methods to interactive theorem proving with proof
                     assistants like Isabelle/HOL. The latter provide overwhelmingly high
                     assurance of the correctness, which automated methods often cannot:
                     due to their complexity, bugs in such automated verification tools are
                     likely and thus the risk of erroneously verifying a flawed protocol is
                     non-negligible. There are a few works that try to combine advantages
                     from both ends of the spectrum: a high degree of automation and
                     assurance. We present here a first step towards achieving this for a
                     more challenging class of protocols, namely those that work with a
                     mutable long-term state. To our knowledge this is the first approach 
                     that achieves fully automated verification of stateful protocols in an
                     LCF-style theorem prover. The approach also includes a simple
                     user-friendly transaction-based protocol specification language
                     embedded into Isabelle, and can also leverage a number of existing
                     results such as soundness of a typed model.},
