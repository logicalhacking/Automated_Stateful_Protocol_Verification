	abstract= {In protocol verification we observe a wide spectrum from fully 
                   automated methods to interactive theorem proving with proof 
                   assistants like Isabelle/HOL. In this AFP entry, we present a 
                   fully-automated approach for verifying stateful security protocols, 
                   i.e., protocols with mutable state that may span several sessions. 
                   The approach supports reachability goals like secrecy and 
                   authentication. We also include a simple user-friendly 
                   transaction-based protocol specification language that is embedded 
                   into Isabelle.},
